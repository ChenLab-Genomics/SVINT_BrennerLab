# Please email jingqichen@fudan.edu.cn if you have any suggestions or encounter any issues when using SVINT.
# SVINT normal only needs 1 or a few minutes.
# In cases where multiple SVs are very large (>5 Mb), SVINT will need more time and more memory to run.

perl: SVINT tested on Perl 5
bedtools: SVINT tested on v2.25.0

1. download "SVINT_v*.tar.gz", and unzip it by:
tar -xvf SVINT_v1.3_hg19.tar.gz
# after unzipping, there will be a folder "SVINT/"

2. cd your-directory/SVINT/
and use this as your working directory
# your-directory is where you unzip your SVINT_*.tar.gz

3. usage examples:
perl src/SVINT_anno_single.pl data/sample/test_data.vcf VCF 0.01
Or
perl src/SVINT_anno_single.pl data/cases/case3_vus.txt TXT 0.001
Or
perl src/SVINT_anno_single_include_exonicSV.pl data/sample/test_data.vcf VCF 0.01
# if everything is alright, it will run through in less than a few minutes.
# if use src/SVINT_anno_single_include_exonicSV.pl, the program will annotate SVs that overlap with exons as well: both the overlapped genes, and the REs and targets affected by the SVs; this may greatly increase the run time and the memory needed if the SVs are very large (>5Mb)
 
# "0.01" and "0.001" are optional cutoffs for FI (FI <=...); this cutoff does not affect the main VCF output, but only applied to the TXT output; if this cutoff is not provided, by default SVINT will use FI<=0.01 for the TXT output 
# the following lines will be output into screen:

It should be successfully done when you see "SVINT done.".
The result will be in the same directory as the input data (data/sample/ or data/cases for the above examples):
(1) **_SVINT_v1.3_anno.vcf 
# above is the main result--SVINT annotated VCF; see meta-information and header stored at the begining of this file for details

(2) TXT format results that are subsets of the main VCF output based on various cutoffs. E.g.:
**_SVINT_v1.4_anno_FI0.01_impact50_1method.txt (FI<=0.01; RE region impacted proportion >=50%; predicted target genes supported by >= 1 prediction method)
**_SVINT_v1.4_anno_FI0.001_impact100_2method.txt (FI<=0.001; RE region impacted proportion =100%; predicted target genes supported by >= 2 prediction methods)

(3) **_RegulatoryRegion--Gene_crossTAD-cells.txt
# this is a file that contains information of the cell types that each observed regulatory region - target gene relationship cross TAD boundaries; if the regulatory region and target gene are >10Mb from each other, it will cross TAD boundaries with a probability >99.9%
# this file is just for information; not essential results
